;; Structs are the basic complex data structures. They are comprised of fields
;; which each have an integer identifier, a type, a symbolic name, and an
;; optional default value.
;;
;; Fields can be declared "optional", which ensures they will not be included
;; in the serialized output if they aren't set.  Note that this requires some
;; manual management in some languages.
